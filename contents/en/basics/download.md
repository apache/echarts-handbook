# Get Apache ECharts

Apache ECharts offers a variety of installation options, so you can choose any of the following options depending on your project.

- Use From GitHub
- Use From npm
- Use From CDN
- Online Customization

We'll go over each of these installation methods and the directory structure after download.

## Installation

### Use From GitHub

You can find links to each version on the [release](https://github.com/apache/echarts/releases) page of the [apache/echarts](https://github.com/apache/echarts) project. Click on the Source code in Assets at the bottom of the download page, and unzip the `echarts.js` file in the `dist` directory to include the full ECharts functionality.

### Use From npm

```sh
npm install echarts --save
```

See [Introducing Apache ECharts in your project](${lang}/basics/import) for details.

### Use From CDN

Recommend referencing [echarts](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/echarts) from jsDelivr.

### Online Customization

If you want to introduce only some modules to reduce package size, you can use the [ECharts online customization](${mainSitePath}/builder.html) function.
