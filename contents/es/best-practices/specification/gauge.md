## Suggestion for Using Gauger Chart

1. The gauger chart is suitable for displaying single progress or measurement standard under quantitative conditions while it is not suitable for carpeting different variables or trends.

2. You can provide info in different dimensions. However, do not include more than 3 pointers in one dashboard. It is recommended to use multiple dashboards if there are indeed multiple data to be displayed.
