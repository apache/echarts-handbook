By reading the documentation and using the search engine, you can solve your problem quickly by yourself without help from the community.\n\nTherefore, before doing anything else, make sure that current documentation and other resources can't solve your problem. Resources that can be helpful for you include,\n\n- [API](${mainSitePath}api.html)\n- [Option Manual](${mainSitePath}option.html) - you can try to use the search function\n- Articles in this handbook\n- [FAQ](${mainSitePath}faq.html)\n- Searching in [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues)\n- Using the search engine\n\n### Create the Minimal Reproducible Demo\n\nCreate an example on [Official Editor](${mainSitePath}examples/editor.html), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Ovilia/pen/dyYWXWM), [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/echarts-basic-example-template-mpfz1s) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/plainheart/e46ozpqj/7/), which will make it easier for others to reproduce your problem.\n\nThe example should reproduce your problem in the simplest way. Removing unnecessary code and data can enable those who want to help you to locate and then solve the problem more quickly. Please refer to [How to Create a Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) for more details.\n\n### Determining if It's a Bug\n\n#### Report a Bug or Request a New Feature\n\nIf some behavior is different from the documentation or isn't what you expected, it's probably a bug. If it's a bug, or you have a feature request, please use the [issue template](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/new/choose) to create a new issue and describe it in detail as per the prompts.\n\n#### How-To Questions\n\nIf it's not a bug, but you don't know how to achieve something, try the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/echarts\">stackoverflow.com</a>\n\nIf you don't get an answer, you can also send an email to [dev@echarts.apache.org](mailto:dev@echarts.apache.org). In order for more people to understand your question and to get help in future searches, it is highly recommended to write the email in English.\n\n## Non-technical questions\n\nFor other non-technical questions, you can send an email in English to [dev@echarts.apache.org](mailto:dev@echarts.apache.org).\n"}}]);
