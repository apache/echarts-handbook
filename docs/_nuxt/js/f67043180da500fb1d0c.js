The core strength of Apache ECharts has always come from a deep understanding of developers\' real challenges. When defining the direction for 6.0, the question was clear: **How can we make complex data presentation both powerful and elegant?**\n\nThis drove us to evolve deeply around three core dimensions:\n\n- **More professional visual presentation**: From a meticulously crafted default theme to intelligent dark mode switching, ensuring charts have a professional look and seamlessly integrate into modern applications.\n- **Expanding the boundaries of data expression**: New chart types and features to handle complex scenarios and enable intuitive expression of deep data.\n- **Unleashing freedom of composition**: From the revolutionary matrix coordinate system to reusable custom series and optimized axis labels—empowering developers to freely compose and turn creativity into unconstrained visual works.\n\nWe have made 12 upgrades across these three core dimensions. These are not just simple feature additions, but a solid foundation for building the next generation of data-driven applications. They all point to one goal: **to make ECharts powerful, reliable, and stable in the background, leaving the stage and spotlight for your creative expression.**\n\nBelow, we introduce these twelve upgrades in detail:\n\n- **More professional visual presentation**\n  - **1. Brand New Default Theme**: Modern design language for professional data expression\n  - **2. Dynamic Theme Switching**: Seamless runtime theme switching for multi-theme scenarios\n  - **3. Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to system dark/light mode for better UX\n- **Expanding the boundaries of data expression**\n  - **4. New Chord Chart**: Visualize complex relationships and distributions\n  - **5. New Beeswarm Chart**: Smartly expand overlapping data points into a honeycomb layout\n  - **6. New Scatter Jittering**: Add jitter to scatter plots for better readability of dense data\n  - **7. New Broken Axis**: Easily present data with large magnitude differences\n  - **8. Enhanced Stock Trading Charts**: Improved label capabilities and more out-of-the-box trading charts\n- **Unleashing freedom of composition**\n  - **9. New Matrix Coordinate System**: Freely combine chart types and components like a table\n  - **10. Enhanced Custom Series**: Support npm publishing and dynamic registration for code reuse\n  - **11. New Custom Charts**: Violin, contour, stage, bar range, and line range charts\n  - **12. Axis Label Optimization**: Smarter default axis label layout to prevent overflow and overlap\n\nWith these upgrades, Apache ECharts 6.0 helps users create more charts more flexibly and conveniently, truly achieving "unlimited possibilities in charting"!\n\n## Feature Details\n\n### 1. Brand New Default Theme\n\nDuring the development of ECharts 6.0, we analyzed real user scenarios and found that over 70% of developers use the default theme. This made us realize: an excellent default theme should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also meet the general needs of various business scenarios.\n\nThe new theme system uses design tokens to reconstruct colors, spacing, and other design elements, **making different chart types and components more harmonious and consistent**.\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/1-default-theme.png" width="600px" />\n\nAlthough the 6.0 theme has significant changes from 5.x, we provide a [v5.js](https://github.com/apache/echarts/blob/master/theme/v5.js) theme file for developers who want to use new features but keep the old style for quick migration.\n\n### 2. Dynamic Theme Switching\n\nIn previous versions, changing a chart\'s theme required disposing of the chart instance and re-initializing, which could negatively impact user experience due to repeated animations. In the new version, we implemented **dynamic theme switching** (see documentation), significantly improving the user experience.\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/2-switch-themes.gif" width="600px" />\n\n### 3. Dark Mode Support\n\nWith dynamic theme registration and switching, a typical scenario is **listening to the system\'s dark mode and dynamically adjusting the chart\'s theme**.\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/3-responsive-themes.gif" width="600px" />\n\nThis is crucial for business scenarios supporting dark mode, ensuring the application interface matches the system theme and greatly enhancing user experience.\n\nHere\'s how to listen for system dark mode and change the chart theme:\n\n```js\nconst darkModeMediaQuery = window.matchMedia(\'(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\');\nfunction updateDarkMode() {\n    const isDarkMode = darkModeMediaQuery.matches;\n    for (const chart of charts) {\n        chart.setTheme(isDarkMode ? \'dark\' : \'default\');\n    }\n}\ndarkModeMediaQuery.addEventListener(\'change\', () => {\n    updateDarkMode();\n});\n```\n\n### 4. New Chord Chart\n\nChord charts intuitively show flows and weights in complex relationship networks, ideal for scenarios like financial transactions and social networks. ECharts innovatively supports **using gradient colors from source and target nodes for edges, creating unique visual effects**. See [series-chord](${optionPath}series-chord).\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/4-chord.gif" width="600px" />\n\n### 5. New Beeswarm Chart\n\nTraditional scatter plots can become overcrowded on category axes. Beeswarm charts use non-numeric axis offsets to **distribute points without overlap while preserving value axis accuracy**. Set [jitter](${optionPath}xAxis.jitter) to a non-zero value and [jitterOverlap](${optionPath}xAxis.jitterOverlap) to `false` to enable beeswarm charts.\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/5-beeswarm.png" width="600px" />\n\n### 6. New Scatter Jittering\n\nScatter jittering adds random offsets to non-data dimensions, **solving the problem of overly dense data points**.\n\nWithout jittering, it\'s hard to see the distribution when data is dense:\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/6-jittering-off.png" width="600px" />\n\nWith jittering enabled, the densest range (6-8) becomes clear. Compared to beeswarm, scatter jittering offers better performance.\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/6-jittering-on.png" width="600px" />\n\nSet [jitter](${optionPath}xAxis.jitter) to a non-zero value and [jitterOverlap](${optionPath}xAxis.jitterOverlap) to `true` to enable scatter jittering.\n\n### 7. New Broken Axis\n\nBroken axis is a visualization technique for showing data with large magnitude differences. In ECharts 6.0, we innovatively implemented a **torn-paper effect for broken axes**, making the meaning more intuitive, and supporting click-to-expand to restore the real data ratio.\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/7-break-axis.gif" width="600px" />\n\n### 8. Enhanced Stock Trading Charts\n\nECharts 6.0 deeply optimizes for financial trading scenarios, enhancing label positioning relative to coordinate systems to help developers quickly build professional-grade trading analysis tools.\n\nBelow is a comprehensive stock trading chart using ECharts, combining **time-sharing, MACD, volume, order book, and depth chart**:\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/8-stock.png" width="600px" />\n\nThese examples help developers quickly meet financial trading needs. For example, displaying numbers in the four corners of the chart can be achieved with [relativeTo](${optionPath}series-line.markPoint.data.relativeTo).\n\n### 9. New Matrix Coordinate System\n\nThe above example also uses the new matrix coordinate system in ECharts 6.0, which is very powerful. It can be used for covariance matrix charts:\n\n<md-example src="matrix-covariance" width="600" height="700" />\n\nPeriodic table:\n\n<md-example src="matrix-periodic-table" width="100%" height="600" />\n\nAs a layout, it also allows developers to combine various chart types and components to create flexible and complex visualizations:\n\n<md-example src="matrix-grid-layout" width="100%" height="600" />\n\n### 10. Enhanced Custom Series\n\nPreviously, using ECharts custom series meant developers had to write complex `renderItem` logic from scratch, and code reuse was limited to copy-pasting. Now, ECharts 6.0 brings a standardized, reusable solution:\n\n- **Custom series registration**: Like theme registration, custom series can be dynamically registered and used as easily as built-in series. See [series-custom.renderItem](${optionPath}series-custom.renderItem)\n- **Official custom series project**: The official project at https://github.com/apache/echarts-custom-series provides multiple custom series, available via npm after the official release\n- **Publish your own custom series**: Submit a pull request to the above project or publish to your own repo for code reuse\n\n### 11. New Custom Charts\n\nThis release provides 6 practical custom charts in the custom series project. See [echarts-custom-series](https://github.com/apache/echarts-custom-series) for usage and documentation. Including **violin chart**:\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-violin.png" width="600px" />\n\n**Contour chart**:\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-contour.png" width="600px" />\n\n**Sleep stage chart**:\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-stage.png" width="600px" />\n\n**Segmented doughnut chart**:\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-segmentedDoughnut.png" width="600px" />\n\n**Bar range chart**:\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-barRange.png" width="600px" />\n\n**Line range chart**:\n\n<img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-lineRange.png" width="600px" />\n\nUnleash your creativity and join us in creating more custom charts!\n\n### 12. Axis Label Optimization\n\nIn previous versions, axis labels and names in rectangular coordinate systems could easily overflow or overlap when data was long. Users couldn\'t always predict space needs as data changed. In this version, we\'ve optimized the default strategies to prevent overflow and overlap.\n\n## Upgrade Guide\n\nSee the full [changelog](${mainSitePath}changelog.html#v6-0-0) and [upgrade guide](${lang}/basics/release-note/v6-upgrade-guide).\n'}}]);
