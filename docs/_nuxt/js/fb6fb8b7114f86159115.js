Compared with the normal line chart, the step line chart significantly shows the sudden changes of analyzed data.\n\nIn ECharts, `step` is used to characterize the connection type of the step line chart. It has three available values: `'start'`, `'end'`, and `'middle'`. For item A and B, these values corresponded that the corner occurred at A, B, and mid-point between A and B.\n\n```js live\noption = {\n  legend: {},\n  xAxis: {\n    type: 'category',\n    data: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']\n  },\n  yAxis: {\n    type: 'value'\n  },\n  series: [\n    {\n      name: 'Step Start',\n      type: 'line',\n      step: 'start',\n      data: [120, 132, 101, 134, 90, 230, 210]\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Step Middle',\n      type: 'line',\n      step: 'middle',\n      data: [220, 282, 201, 234, 290, 430, 410]\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Step End',\n      type: 'line',\n      step: 'end',\n      data: [450, 432, 401, 454, 590, 530, 510]\n    }\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n> Please focus on the difference of line between three separate types.\n"}}]);
